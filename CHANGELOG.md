## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Engineering Project Hub MVP: a static, GitHub-native portal with a project-level view of multi-repository software delivery.
- TypeScript collector with GitHub (Octokit, GitHub App / fine-grained token / `GITHUB_TOKEN`) and mock providers, classified error handling (403/404/rate limit) and partial-data tolerance.
- Normalised snapshot model (Zod, strict allowlist schemas, `schemaVersion` 1.0) and generated JSON Schemas in `config/schema/`.
- Health evaluators for delivery, version, security risk, coverage, governance and overall, driven by `config/policies.yaml`.
- Sanitisation pipeline (projection, scrubbing, URL allowlist, publication gate) and an output secret scan.
- Astro static site in English and Italian: Portfolio, Project detail, Workflows, Versions, Security and Data quality views; light/dark themes; accessible status badges.
- Synthetic fixtures for three demo projects, golden snapshots, unit, integration and Playwright e2e tests.
- GitHub Actions: `ci.yml`, `collect-data.yml` and `deploy-pages.yml` built on reusable `rw-*` building blocks; GitHub Pages deployment via OIDC.
- Bilingual documentation (EN/IT): README, architecture, security, configuration, operations, CI and ADRs 0001–0003.

### Security

- Read-only by design: no write calls, alert dismissals or workflow triggers. Secret scanning alerts are fetched with `hide_secret=true` and only the secret type is kept.
- The public demo publishes synthetic mock data only.
